TA Comments on Design:-

selected? vs clicked?
You don’t need the clicked? 
selected? interpretation is missing.
world-after-tick examples missing, break the code down please.
Breaking world and circle in the same function
new-circle - too big of a code. Please break the code down into multiple functions for readability.
world-to-scene : too many cases, it can also be broken down into smaller functions for readability.
Don’t need to consider the cases individually, you can club them together.
place-redcirc and place-bluecirc can be generalized into one function
